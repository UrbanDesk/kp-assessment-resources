Resources for the assessment

Check the instructions for your stack below:

## Frontend Developer
You're required to develop a **landing, sign in and sign up** pages and integrate (just the auth pages) to a mock API server. This task tests your design skills and backend integration skills. We recommend using React and material-ui UI library for the designs. Check the **frontend** folder for the pages to design.

## Mobile Developer
You're required to develop two screens **(sign in and sign up)**. The screens should be integrated to a mock API server. Check the **mobile** folder for the screens to design. We recommend using Flutter for this.

## Backend Developer
You're required to develop a NodeJS API server with two basic routes:
- **Login Route**: This route should allow an existing user login.
- **Registration Route**: This route should allow a new user register.

**HINT:** Your implementation should be properly secured and follow best practices needed for maximum API protection. A real database is not required, you can use an in-memory data store (a simple array will do).
